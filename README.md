# Gun-Death-Analysis-in-R
FiveThirtyEight, a data journalism site devoted to politics, sports, science, economics,
and culture, recently published a series of articles on gun deaths in America. Gun violence in the
United States is a significant political issue, and while reducing gun deaths is a noble goal, we must first
understand the causes and patterns in gun violence in order to craft appropriate policies. As part of the
project, FiveThirtyEight collected data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as
other governmental agencies and non-profits, on all gun deaths in the United States from 2012-2014.

(a) Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of gun deaths per month. Print the data
frame as a formatted kable() table.

(b) Generate a bar chart with labels on the x-axis. That is, each month should be labeled “Jan”,
“Feb”, “Mar” and etc.

(c) Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of gun deaths associated with each type of intent
cause of death. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest values.

(d) Generate a boxplot visualizing the age of gun death victims, by sex. Print the average age of
female gun death victims.Answer the following questions. Generate appropriate figures/tables to support your conclusions.

(e) How many white males with at least a high school education were killed by guns in 2012?

(f) Which season of the year has the most gun deaths? Assume that
– Winter = January - March
– Spring = April - June
– Summer = July - September
– Fall = October - December
– Hint: You need to convert a continuous variable into a categorical variable.

(g) Are whites who are killed by guns more likely to die because of suicide or homicide? How does
this compare to blacks and Hispanics?

(h) Are police-involved gun deaths significantly different from other gun deaths? Assess the relationship between police involvement and other variables.
